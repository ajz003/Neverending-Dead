# Project 2 Instructions:

## Goal:
  
  * Build something awesome for your portfolio

  * Improve your full-stack and Git skills

## Requirements:

  * Must be a full-stack Node/Express application

  * Must utilize a MySQL database

  * Routes must follow RESTful guidelines (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

  * Must use at least one new technology, front-end library, or npm package that we haven't talked about in class

  * Must be deployed to Heroku (or similar)

    * _Do not make light of this step. Deploy and test early!_

  * Codebase must be well-organized using MVC architecture (models, views, controllers)
  
    * _You will get docked points if you have node\_modules or DS\_Store files checked into your repository_

## Optionals:

  * Handlebars (if your website is mostly static content)

  * User login (but only if it makes sense to have accounts)

    * _If you add a user login, look into implementing cookies and sessions to keep users signed in. DO NOT USE PASSPORT. You are not ready for it yet._

  * Third-party APIs

    * _Now that you are back-end developers, you aren't restricted by CORS errors or other authentication blocks._

## Presentation Date:

  * Thursday, October 11th

    * Presentations will be recorded, so you _must_ use the instructor's laptop to demo it.

    * You will have 8 minutes to show off your app and talk about why you made the decisions you did, what technologies you used, what challenges you faced, etc.

## Other Advice:

  * Before you have a working front-end, you can test your API routes using Postman.

  * Use the Chrome dev tools > network tab to verify if the front-end is making the correct requests.

  * Manage your project with Trello. Break it up into phases and keep each task small in scope.

  * Hold daily "scrum" meetings in the morning where you meet as a team and everyone answers three questions:

    1. What did you work on yesterday?
    2. What will you work on today?
    3. Are you blocked by anything?

  * If you use GitHub pull requests to merge branches, enforce code reviews, meaning someone else on the team has to accept the pull request. If you manually merge branches on the command line, _test the merge before pushing to master!_
