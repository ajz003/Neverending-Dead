# The Neverending Dead

#### A simple RPG boss rush game where the player must defeat an army of other players who've died trying to reach the final boss.
#### If the player dies, his or her current health points and attack rating will be recorded. Their dead character will be pushed into the database, joining the army of undead players.
#### If the last boss is defeated, the curse transfers to the character and makes him or her the new and final boss that other players will have to defeat.

## Instructions:
* Players must customize, name, and create a character.
* In the first round, players start with 25 attack rating and 300 health points. 
* If the player defeats their current enemy, their character's attack rating and health points will increase. They are also rewarded with gold.
* After defeating an enemy, players will be treated to the shopkeeper where they can spend their gold to buy items or skills.
* However, if the player dies, their characters will join the line of enemies.
